## Our history

Founded in 2015 by a group of friends in Paris, Cream is dedicated to robotics. Our association is a hub where innovation and collaboration merge, propelled by the original spirit of camaraderie and technical exploration.

## Our mission

At Cream, our mission is twofold:

- To provide a space where robotics enthusiasts can meet, exchange ideas and work together on stimulating projects.
- To actively participate in the Coupe de France de Robotique, an event that enables us to put our know-how into practice, measure ourselves against other teams and live out our passion for robotics at the highest level.

## Our achievements

Over the years, we've taken part in the Coupe de France de Robotique with enthusiasm and determination. Here are some of the highlights of our journey:

- 2023 • Quarter-finals
- 2018 - 2023 • 5 times in the final phase
- 2018 • Jury's prize
- 2015 • First entry and Jury's Prize
